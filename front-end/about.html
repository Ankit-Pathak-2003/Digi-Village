        <h2>What is Indra?</h2>
        <p>Indra is a web based forecasting service using environmental parameters like temperature, soil moisture, humidity etc for 
            precision agriculture. These parameters affect the yield of crops. The accurate prediction of these parameters can help 
            a farmer plan well in terms of irrigation needs and other requirements so as to maximize crop yield both in terms of 
            quality as well as quantity. It has two fold uses:</p><br>
            <ul>
            <li>First, to study existing patterns of environmental parameters like humidity, air temperature etc. using data collected 
                through on ground sensors or remote sensing, across a time series to predict future values of these environmental 
                parameters.</li>
            <li>Second, to formulate the relationship between these parameters and the yield of crop. To be precise, the teams are 
                expected to predict yield values based on these input parameters.</li></ul>

        <h2>How do we do it?</h2>
        <p>Our collection of data contains values of environmental parameters, soil moisture, humidity, temperature, pressure, and 
            luminosity (sunlight) collected through on-ground sensors in regular intervals. The sample space of data covers two years 
            worth of research in different parameters. A time series prediction model is being used to predict values of environmental 
            parameters, soil moisture, humidity, temperature, pressure, and luminosity (sunlight) for the next interval. The model also 
            predicts the final yield of the wheat crop based on these parameters.</p>

                <h2>Important Parameters</h2>
                <p>The forecasting model works on some major parameters like mean squared error, mean absolute error, etc.</p>
